# First CSE 110 Lab!
## A little about me
As of completing this lab, I am a third-year computer science major with a minor in sociology and first year transfer from NorCal. A large reason I chose CS as opposed to other paths was it's accessibility and low-cost when it comes to creating new and useful products. 

Outside of the academic and CS sphere, I'm interested in most activities that involve creation, such as sewing, knitting, and pottery. 

## _Anyways... here is a cat in overalls_

> If the cat could speak he would likely express his displeasure

```
if (speaksEnglish == True){
    return "I am displeased";
}
else{
    return "meow";
}
```

Here is a section link back to the [cat picture](#here-is-a-cat-in-overalls)

Guess where this [link](catBetweenDisks.jpeg) goes:
1. Another cat picture
2. A picture of a row of CDs
3. All of the above
4. Nowhere :(
